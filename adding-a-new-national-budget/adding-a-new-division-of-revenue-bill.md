# Adding a new Division of Revenue bill

There is:

* One DOR per financial year
* One dataset per DOR
* Two resources per DOR dataset

Each year's Division of Revenue bill should be a separate dataset with:

* One PDF resource \(Division of Revenue bill\)
* One XLS resource \(Annexes\)

Each DOR should be in the "Division of Revenue Bills" group.
