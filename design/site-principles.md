# Site principles

* Initial assumption: Departments only change at the boundaries of financial years. That means we could have a department instance repeated for each financial year it exists, and where it doesn't exist in cross-year navigation, we could detect it quite easily and link to the government where it might have existed instead. We could also have added a manual mapping to the department\(s\) in the other year that are related to the change in government structure.
* Potentially upcoming: Departments might change within a financial year.
